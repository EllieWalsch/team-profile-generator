# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is an easy-to-use app to help companies build a webpage that displays their team and their contact information all in one place.

In this project, I got more confortable using Node, Inquirer, and began to practice testing. Testing is an important part of development as it allows us to ensure that everything is functioning correctly. If there are any issues, it is much easier to find the problem through a failing test rather than scouring lines of code to identify the problem.

## Installation

First, download the repo. Then open the terminal and make sure you're in the "team-profile-generator" directory. You're now ready to run the app!

## Usage

In the terminal, type "node index.js" and answer the following prompts. After all team members are added, click "I don't want to add more team members." This will generate a HTML file that can then be deployed or opened with a live server. [Click here for a walkthrough video.]()
